# Live Repo Repair Plan

## Preconditions

- Repo: /home/pc/projects/womanvshorseVB
- Audit stayed non-mutating. No repo or product-code edits were made by this diagnosis run.

## Triage Order

- package_first_count: 0
- subject_repo_follow_up_count: 3
- host_or_manual_prerequisite_count: 0

## Package Changes Required First

- None recorded.

## Post-Update Repair Actions

- No safe managed-surface repair was identified from the current findings.

## Ticket Follow-Up

### REMED-004

- linked_report_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- action_type: generated-repo remediation ticket/process repair
- should_scafforge_repair_run: only after managed workflow repair converges
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.
- assignee: implementer
- suggested_fix_approach: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.

## Reverification Plan

- After package-side fixes land, run one fresh audit on the subject repo before applying another repair cycle.
- After managed repair, rerun the public repair verifier and confirm restart surfaces, ticket routing, and any historical trust restoration paths match the current canonical state.
- Do not treat restart prose alone as proof; the canonical manifest and workflow state remain the source of truth.
