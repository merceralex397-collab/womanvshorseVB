# Initial Codebase Review

## Scope

- subject repo: /home/pc/projects/womanvshorseVB
- diagnosis timestamp: 2026-04-11T18:08:20Z
- audit scope: managed workflow, restart, ticket, prompt, and execution surfaces
- verification scope: current repo state only

## Result State

- result_state: validated failures found
- finding_count: 3
- errors: 3
- warnings: 0

## Validated Findings

### Workflow Findings

### WFLOW019

- finding_id: WFLOW019
- summary: The ticket graph contains stale or contradictory source/follow-up linkage.
- severity: error
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json
- observed_or_reproduced: The repo has follow-up tickets whose lineage, dependency edges, or parent linkage no longer agree with the current manifest. Without a canonical reconciliation path, agents get trapped between stale source-follow-up history and current evidence.
- evidence:
  - SETUP-001 lists SETUP-002 in follow_up_ticket_ids, but SETUP-002 names None as source_ticket_id.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

## Code Quality Findings

### EXEC-REMED-001

- finding_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- summary: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/reviews/remed-001-review-reverification.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket REMED-001 carries finding_source `EXEC-GODOT-005a`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/reviews/remed-001-review-reverification.md
  - missing exact command record

### EXEC-REMED-001

- finding_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- summary: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/reviews/remed-002-review-reverification.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket REMED-002 carries finding_source `EXEC-REMED-001`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/reviews/remed-002-review-reverification.md
  - missing exact command record

## Verification Gaps

- The diagnosis pack validates the concrete failures above. It does not claim broader runtime-path coverage than the current audit and supporting evidence actually exercised.
