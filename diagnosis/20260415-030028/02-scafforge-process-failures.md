# Scafforge Process Failures

## Scope

- Maps each validated finding back to the Scafforge-owned workflow surface that allowed it through.

## Failure Map

### EXEC-REMED-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-REMED-001
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-REMED-001
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces

### CONFIG010

- linked_report_1_finding: CONFIG010
- implicated_surface: scafforge-audit diagnosis contract

### EXEC-GODOT-008

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-GODOT-008
- implicated_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface

- implicated_surface: project-skill-bootstrap and agent-prompt-engineering surfaces
- ownership_class: project skill or prompt surface
- workflow_failure: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text or stale synthesized guidance instead of current project-specific procedure.

## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-REMED-001

- root_cause: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- safer_target_pattern: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### CONFIG010

- root_cause: Legacy scaffold or repair runs did not propagate the deterministic asset route metadata and starter layout into the repo.
- safer_target_pattern: Backfill the rendered asset starter surfaces from the current package during managed repair and keep them aligned to the canonical finish contract.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: A managed game repo is missing canonical asset-pipeline starter surfaces.

### EXEC-GODOT-008

- root_cause: The project still contains invalid `uid://...` references in scene or resource manifests, so Godot is recovering at runtime by ignoring the recorded UID and loading the text path instead.
- safer_target_pattern: Treat invalid UID fallback warnings as actionable load drift: refresh the affected scene/resource references or import metadata until `godot --headless --path . --quit` succeeds with no UID fallback warnings.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Godot headless load only succeeds by falling back from stale resource UIDs.

### SKILL001

- root_cause: project-skill-bootstrap or later managed-surface repair left repo-local skills in a placeholder or stale state, so agents lose concrete stack, validation, or asset-workflow guidance.
- safer_target_pattern: Populate every required repo-local skill with concrete current rules and validation commands; generated `.opencode/skills/` files must not retain template filler or stale synthesized workflow guidance.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text or stale synthesized guidance instead of current project-specific procedure.
