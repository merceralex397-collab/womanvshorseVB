# Scafforge Process Failures

## Scope

- Maps each validated finding back to the Scafforge-owned workflow surface that allowed it through.

## Failure Map

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-GODOT-004
- implicated_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Godot headless validation fails.

### WFLOW019

- linked_report_1_finding: WFLOW019
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: The ticket graph contains stale or contradictory source/follow-up linkage.

### WFLOW020

- linked_report_1_finding: WFLOW020
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: Open-parent ticket decomposition is missing or routed through non-canonical source modes.

### SKILL001

- linked_report_1_finding: SKILL001
- implicated_surface: project-skill-bootstrap and agent-prompt-engineering surfaces
- ownership_class: project skill or prompt surface
- workflow_failure: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text instead of project-specific guidance.

## Ownership Classification

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- affected_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces

### WFLOW019

- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- affected_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces

### WFLOW020

- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- affected_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces

### SKILL001

- ownership_class: project skill or prompt surface
- affected_surface: project-skill-bootstrap and agent-prompt-engineering surfaces

## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- root_cause: The project cannot complete a deterministic headless Godot load pass on the current host, indicating broken project configuration or scripts.
- safer_target_pattern: Run a deterministic `godot --headless --path . --quit` validation during audit and keep the repo blocked until it succeeds or returns an explicit environment blocker instead.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Godot headless validation fails.

### WFLOW019

- root_cause: The repo has follow-up tickets whose lineage, dependency edges, or parent linkage no longer agree with the current manifest. Without a canonical reconciliation path, agents get trapped between stale source-follow-up history and current evidence.
- safer_target_pattern: Use `ticket_reconcile` to atomically repair stale source/follow-up linkage, remove contradictory parent dependencies, and supersede invalidated follow-up tickets from current evidence.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The ticket graph contains stale or contradictory source/follow-up linkage.

### WFLOW020

- root_cause: The workflow lacks a first-class split route for child tickets created from an open parent, or it still renders split parents as blocked, so agents encode decomposition through remediation semantics and the parent/child graph drifts.
- safer_target_pattern: Support `ticket_create(source_mode=split_scope)` for open-parent decomposition, keep the parent open and non-foreground, and keep open-parent child tickets out of `net_new_scope` and `post_completion_issue` routing.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Open-parent ticket decomposition is missing or routed through non-canonical source modes.

### SKILL001

- root_cause: project-skill-bootstrap or later managed-surface repair left baseline local skills in a scaffold placeholder state, so agents lose concrete stack and validation guidance.
- safer_target_pattern: Populate every baseline local skill with concrete repo-specific rules and validation commands; generated `.opencode/skills/` files must not retain template filler.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text instead of project-specific guidance.
