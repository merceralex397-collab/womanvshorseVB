# Live Repo Repair Plan

## Preconditions

- Repo: /home/pc/projects/womanvshorseVB
- Audit stayed non-mutating. No repo or product-code edits were made by this diagnosis run.

## Triage Order

- package_first_count: 0
- subject_repo_follow_up_count: 1
- host_or_manual_prerequisite_count: 0

## Package Changes Required First

- None recorded.

## Post-Update Repair Actions

- Route 3 workflow-layer finding(s) into `scafforge-repair` for deterministic managed-surface refresh.

- After deterministic repair, rerun project-local skill regeneration, agent-team follow-up, and prompt hardening before handoff.

### REMED-002

- linked_report_id: WFLOW019
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Use `ticket_reconcile` to atomically repair stale source/follow-up linkage, remove contradictory parent dependencies, and supersede invalidated follow-up tickets from current evidence.

### REMED-003

- linked_report_id: WFLOW020
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Support `ticket_create(source_mode=split_scope)` for open-parent decomposition, keep the parent open and non-foreground, and keep open-parent child tickets out of `net_new_scope` and `post_completion_issue` routing.

### REMED-004

- linked_report_id: SKILL001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Populate every baseline local skill with concrete repo-specific rules and validation commands; generated `.opencode/skills/` files must not retain template filler.

## Ticket Follow-Up

### REMED-001

- linked_report_id: EXEC-GODOT-004
- action_type: generated-repo remediation ticket/process repair
- should_scafforge_repair_run: only after managed workflow repair converges
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Run a deterministic `godot --headless --path . --quit` validation during audit and keep the repo blocked until it succeeds or returns an explicit environment blocker instead.
- assignee: implementer
- suggested_fix_approach: Run a deterministic `godot --headless --path . --quit` validation during audit and keep the repo blocked until it succeeds or returns an explicit environment blocker instead.

## Reverification Plan

- After package-side fixes land, run one fresh audit on the subject repo before applying another repair cycle.
- After managed repair, rerun the public repair verifier and confirm restart surfaces, ticket routing, and any historical trust restoration paths match the current canonical state.
- Do not treat restart prose alone as proof; the canonical manifest and workflow state remain the source of truth.
