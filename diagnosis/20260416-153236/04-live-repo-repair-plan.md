# Live Repo Repair Plan

## Preconditions

- Repo: /home/rowan/womanvshorseVB
- Audit stayed non-mutating. No repo or product-code edits were made by this diagnosis run.

## Triage Order

- package_first_count: 0
- subject_repo_follow_up_count: 0
- host_or_manual_prerequisite_count: 0

## Package Changes Required First

- None recorded.

## Post-Update Repair Actions

- Route 4 workflow-layer finding(s) into `scafforge-repair` for deterministic managed-surface refresh.

### REMED-013

- linked_report_id: BOOT003
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Hash stack-sensitive repo surfaces plus host-side prerequisite signals so bootstrap becomes stale when the machine setup changes, then rerun environment_bootstrap after package repair installs the stronger freshness model.

### REMED-014

- linked_report_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.

### REMED-015

- linked_report_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.

### REMED-016

- linked_report_id: FINISH004
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Replace generic machine-generated finish_acceptance_signals with repo-specific interactive proof requirements, and require FINISH-VALIDATE-001 to demand user-observable interaction evidence in addition to load/export proof.

## Ticket Follow-Up

- No subject-repo ticket follow-up was recommended from the current diagnosis run.

## Reverification Plan

- After package-side fixes land, run one fresh audit on the subject repo before applying another repair cycle.
- After managed repair, rerun the public repair verifier and confirm restart surfaces, ticket routing, and any historical trust restoration paths match the current canonical state.
- Do not treat restart prose alone as proof; the canonical manifest and workflow state remain the source of truth.
